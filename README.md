## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

The fertilizer industry and warehouses face major security, inventory management, and safety challenges, such as:

ðŸ”´ **Theft & Unauthorized Access** â€“ High-value chemicals & fertilizers are stolen due to poor surveillance.  
ðŸ”´ **Hazardous Material Monitoring** â€“ Fertilizers are chemically sensitive and require real-time monitoring to prevent contamination or spoilage.  
ðŸ”´ **Inefficient Inventory Tracking** â€“ Manual inventory checks waste time and lead to errors.  
ðŸ”´ **Fire & Gas Leak Detection** â€“ Some fertilizers (e.g., ammonium nitrate) are highly flammable and need constant safety checks.  
ðŸ”´ **Poor Surveillance Coverage** â€“ Traditional CCTV cameras lack AI intelligence for active monitoring.  

### ðŸ’¡ Solution: AI-Powered Autonomous Surveillance Rover

A smart AI rover that patrols fertilizer warehouses autonomously and performs:

âœ… **Real-time Object Detection** â€“ Tracks inventory, detects human intrusion, and identifies gas leaks.  
âœ… **Live GPS Tracking & Speed Monitoring** â€“ Monitors movement within the warehouse.  
âœ… **AI-based Security Alerts** â€“ Notifies about unauthorized personnel, fire, and theft detection.  
âœ… **Automated Dashboard** â€“ Monitors fertilizer stock levels, intrusions, and hazardous areas.
